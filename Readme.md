Authors: Abdullah Salous, Chase Cummins, and Zain Chaudry

After cloning the project and with Python 3.0+ installed, you should be able to run the password generator with 

```python3 password_generator.py``` 

or 

`./password_generator.py` 

as long as the file has executable permissions. If permissions are not enabled, then you can add them with 

`chmod +x password_generator.py`
